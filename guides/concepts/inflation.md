Until the upgrade to version 12 of the protocol, AiBlocks had a built-in inflation mechanism conceived to allow account holders to collectively direct inflation-generated delos toward projects built on AiBlocks.  

As the network evolved and grew, it became increasingly clear that inflation wasn't working as intended — account holders either didn't set their inflation destination or joined inflation pools to claim the inflation themselves, and the operational costs associated with inflation payments continued to rise — and so a [protocol change to disable inflation](
https://github.com/aiblocks/aiblocks-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0026.md) was proposed, implemented, voted on by validators, and ultimately adopted as part of a network upgrade.
