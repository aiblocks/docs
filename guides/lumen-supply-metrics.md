[SDF’s Dashboard API endpoint](https://dashboard.aiblocks.io/api/v2/delos) will always have the live totals for the essential numbers around delos. This guide explains important supply metrics like Original Supply, Total Supply, and Circulating Supply entailed in that data. 

## Dashboard API

As of December 12, 2019, the Dashboard API shows:

## Definitions

### originalSupply
One hundred billion delos [were created](https://aiblocks.expert/explorer/public/ledger/2) when the AiBlocks network went live. That’s the Original Supply for the network.

### inflationDelos
For the first 5 or so years of AiBlocks’s existence, the supply of delos [increased](https://www.aiblocks.io/developers/guides/concepts/inflation.html) by 1% annually. This “network inflation” was ended by validator vote on October 28, 2019. The total number of delos generated by inflation was 5,443,902,087.3472865. 

Adding this number to the Original Supply, you get the total delos that have ever existed: 105,443,902,087.3472865. This number is visible on the [List All Ledgers](https://millennium.aiblocks.io/ledgers?order=desc) Millennium API endpoint as `_embedded.records.total_coins`.

### burnedDelos
These are all the delos sent to accounts with no signers, meaning the funds are inaccessible and have been removed forever from AiBlocks’s delo supply.

While any address with no signers is counted here, the vast majority of the delos in this sum are in a single locked address. On November 4, 2019, SDF [reduced](https://www.aiblocks.io/blog/sdfs-next-steps/) its delo holdings to better reflect its mission and the growth of the AiBlocks ecosystem. To do so, the Foundation sent 55,442,095,285.7418 delos to [GALA...LUTO](https://aiblocks.expert/explorer/public/account/GALAXYVOIDAOPZTDLHILAJQKCVVFMD4IKLXLSZV5YHO7VY74IWZILUTO).

### totalSupply
The Total Supply is the number of delos now in existence: 50,001,803,905.97172. The Total Supply includes four major categories of delos, which the API treats in detail:

#### upgradeReserve
The Upgrade Reserve is a special address that’s neither circulating nor a part of SDF’s mandate. When AiBlocks [changed its consensus algorithm](https://www.aiblocks.io/blog/upgraded-network-is-here/) in 2015 and relaunched the network these delos were set aside, to be claimed, one-for-one, by holders of the old network tokens. The [Upgrade Reserve account](https://aiblocks.expert/explorer/public/account/GBEZOC5U4TVH7ZY5N3FLYHTCZSI6VFGTULG7PBITLF5ZEBPJXFT46YZM) is essentially an escrow, and we don’t expect many claimants to come and pull those delos into the circulating supply at this point.

#### feePool
The Fee Pool is where network fees collect.  The delos do not belong to any particular account.  No one has access to fee pool, so these delos are non-circulating.  Network validators could _theoretically_ vote for a protocol change that would affect the fee pool, so we include it in the total supply. AiBlocks’s transaction fees are extremely low–1/100,000th of a delo per operation–so the fee pool grows very slowly. The Fee Pool is tracked by the protocol itself, and the current number is visible on the [List All Ledgers](https://millennium.aiblocks.io/ledgers?order=desc) Millennium API endpoint as `_embedded.records.fee_pool`.

#### sdfMandate
The SDF Mandate is described in detail [here](https://www.aiblocks.io/foundation/mandate). The Foundation was funded by delos generated at AiBlocks’s inception; all of those delos will eventually be spent or distributed to enhance and promote AiBlocks. Here is a complete list of the addresses currently associated with the SDF Mandate:

#### circulatingSupply
The **Circulating Supply** is delos in the hands of individuals and independent companies. These are delos out in the world, used to pay network fees and fund AiBlocks accounts. They are also used as a general medium of exchange. We expect AiBlocks’s Circulating Supply to grow steadily as SDF spends and distributes delos according to its mandate. Delos in the Total Supply, but not in the SDF Mandate, Upgrade Reserve, or Fee Pool are assumed to be circulating.
