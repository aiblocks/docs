Millennium is the client-facing API server for the AiBlocks ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between [AiBlocks Core](https://github.com/aiblocks/aiblocks-core) and applications that want to access the AiBlocks network. Millennium allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, and subscribe to event streams. For more details, see an [overview of the AiBlocks network](https://www.aiblocks.io/developers/guides/).

You can interact directly with Millennium via cURL or a web browser. AiBlocks.io also provides a [JavaScript SDK](https://www.aiblocks.io/developers/js-aiblocks-sdk/reference/) for clients to use to interact with Millennium.

AiBlocks.io runs an [instance of Millennium](https://millennium-testnet.aiblocks.io/) that is connected to the [testnet](../guides/concepts/test-net.md).
